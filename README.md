Sentiment Analysis using BERT Transformer

- Model Architecture:
◦ The chosen architecture for this sentiment analysis task is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
◦ BERT is a pre-trained transformer-based neural network that excels in natural language understanding tasks.
◦ It utilizes a bidirectional attention mechanism to capture context from both left and right contexts in a sentence.
◦ Fine-tuning BERT for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis, involves adding a classification layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model.

- Choice of Dataset:
◦ The dataset used for training and evaluation is the IMDB Movie Reviews Large Dataset.
◦ This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, evenly split between positive and negative sentiments.
◦ Each review is labeled as either ‘positive’ or ‘negative’.
◦ The dataset provides a diverse range of text samples, making it suitable for training a sentiment analysis model.

- Challenges Faced During Implementation:
◦ Data Preprocessing: BERT requires specific tokenization and input formatting. Ensuring proper preprocessing was crucial.
◦ Memory and Computation: BERT is a large model with many parameters. Training it can be memory-intensive and time-consuming.
◦ Hyperparameter Tuning: Choosing an appropriate learning rate and batch size was essential for optimal performance.
◦ Class Imbalance: Although the IMDB dataset is balanced, real-world datasets may have class imbalances that affect model performance.

- Model Evaluation Results:
◦ The trained model achieved the following results on the test set:
◦ Recall: 0.85 (proportion of actual positives correctly predicted)
◦ F1-Score: 0.87 (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
◦ The confusion matrix provides additional insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In summary, the BERT-based sentiment analysis model demonstrated strong performance on the IMDB dataset, capturing nuances in movie reviews’ sentiments. Further fine-tuning and experimentation could enhance its robustness for other domains or languages.
